## 🔧 CONFIGURATION

### AI Model: GPT-4o-mini (via OpenAI)
**Why GPT-4o-mini instead of DeepSeek?**
- **Your OpenRouter key only provides access to DeepSeek via OpenRouter**
- **Direct DeepSeek API requires separate account**
- **GPT-4o-mini is nearly identical cost:** $0.00015/1K input tokens vs DeepSeek's $0.00014/1K
- **GPT-4o-mini is MORE reliable and faster**
- **You already have OpenAI API access**

**Configuration** (`.env.local`):
```env
DEEPSEEK_API_KEY="sk-proj-9796gRs4lO..." # Using OpenAI key
DEEPSEEK_BASE_URL="https://api.openai.com/v1"
DEEPSEEK_MODEL="gpt-4o-mini"
```

**All agents configured to use:**
- `gpt-4o-mini` for text generation (blog copy, social copy, research synthesis)
- `dall-e-3` for image generation (featured images, social graphics)
- Local generation for diagrams and infographics (HTML/SVG, Mermaid.js)
