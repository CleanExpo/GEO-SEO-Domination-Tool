## ‚úèÔ∏è Method 2: Customize Existing Scripts

### Step 1: Pick a Script to Modify

Let's customize the competitor analysis script:

```bash
# Open the file in your editor
code scripts/examples/gemini-seo-competitor-analysis.ts
```

### Step 2: Change the Target URL

Find this section (around line 44):

```typescript
const result = await service.executeTask({
  description: `
    Visit https://example.com (replace with competitor URL) and analyze:
    1. Extract all H1, H2, H3 headings
    2. Identify the main topic/focus of the homepage
    3. Count the number of service offerings mentioned
    4. Check if they have a blog or resources section
    5. Note any call-to-action buttons
  `,
  startUrl: 'https://example.com', // ‚Üê CHANGE THIS
  maxSteps: 10,
});
```

**Replace with your competitor:**

```typescript
const result = await service.executeTask({
  description: `
    Visit https://my-competitor.com and analyze:
    1. Extract all H1, H2, H3 headings
    2. Identify the main topic/focus of the homepage
    3. Count the number of service offerings mentioned
    4. Check if they have a blog or resources section
    5. Note any call-to-action buttons
  `,
  startUrl: 'https://my-competitor.com', // ‚Üê YOUR COMPETITOR
  maxSteps: 10,
});
```

### Step 3: Run Your Customized Script

```bash
npm run gemini:competitor
```

**Watch the magic happen:**
- Browser opens automatically
- AI navigates to your competitor's site
- Actions are logged in real-time
- Results displayed when complete

## üí° Method 3: Write Your Own Automation

### Step 1: Use the Template

I've created a starter template for you:

```bash
# Edit the template
code scripts/my-seo-automation.ts
```

### Step 2: Customize the Task

Find the `CUSTOMIZE THIS SECTION` area:

```typescript
const result = await service.executeTask({
  description: `
    YOUR TASK HERE - Examples:

    - "Visit competitor.com and check if they have a blog"
    - "Search 'plumber Brisbane' on Google and tell me the top 3 results"
    - "Go to example.com and extract all their service page titles"
    - "Check if mysite.com loads correctly on mobile view"

    Replace this with your actual task!
  `,
  startUrl: 'https://example.com', // ‚Üê Change this URL
  maxSteps: 15,
});
```

**Replace with YOUR task:**

```typescript
const result = await service.executeTask({
  description: `
    Visit https://competitor.com/services and:
    1. List all service categories mentioned
    2. Check if they have pricing information visible
    3. Note any "Book Now" or "Get Quote" buttons
    4. Identify if they offer emergency services
  `,
  startUrl: 'https://competitor.com/services',
  maxSteps: 15,
});
```

### Step 3: Run Your Custom Automation

```bash
npx tsx scripts/my-seo-automation.ts
```

## üéì Understanding the Code

### Basic Structure

Every automation follows this pattern:

```typescript
import { GeminiComputerUseService, getGeminiApiKey } from '../services/api/gemini-computer-use';
import * as dotenv from 'dotenv';

dotenv.config({ path: '.env.local' });

async function myTask() {
  // 1. Initialize the service
  const service = new GeminiComputerUseService({
    apiKey: getGeminiApiKey(),
    headless: false, // Show browser (true to hide)
  });

  try {
    // 2. Start the browser
    await service.initialize();

    // 3. Execute your task
    const result = await service.executeTask({
      description: 'What you want the AI to do',
      startUrl: 'Where to start',
      maxSteps: 15, // How many actions max
    });

    // 4. Handle results
    if (result.success) {
      console.log('Success!', result.steps);
    } else {
      console.log('Failed:', result.error);
    }

    // 5. Clean up
    await service.cleanup();
  } catch (error) {
    await service.cleanup();
  }
}

myTask();
```

### Key Parameters

**`description`** - Tell the AI what to do:
```typescript
description: `
  Visit example.com and:
  1. Extract the main heading
  2. Count how many images are on the page
  3. Check if there's a contact form
`
```

**`startUrl`** - Where to begin:
```typescript
startUrl: 'https://example.com'
```

**`maxSteps`** - Limit actions (prevents infinite loops):
```typescript
maxSteps: 15 // Typically 10-20 is good
```

**`headless`** - Show/hide browser:
```typescript
headless: false // false = show browser (good for debugging)
headless: true  // true = hide browser (faster, production)
```

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Notes

### Payment Blocking is ALWAYS Active

The system will BLOCK any task that involves:
- ‚ùå Payment pages (checkout, cart, billing)
- ‚ùå Credit card forms
- ‚ùå Purchase buttons
- ‚ùå Payment keywords

**Example blocked action:**
```
üö® PAYMENT BLOCKED: URL contains payment-related domain: checkout
```

**This is GOOD** - it means your safety system is working!

### Safe vs. Unsafe Tasks

‚úÖ **SAFE - These work perfectly:**
- Viewing public web pages
- Searching on Google/Google Maps
- Reading blog posts
- Extracting visible text and headings
- Checking page layouts
- Analyzing competitor content

‚ùå **BLOCKED - These will be stopped:**
- Accessing /checkout URLs
- Filling out credit card forms
- Clicking "Buy Now" buttons
- Entering payment information

---

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### "Task failed" or "No more actions needed"

**This is normal!** Sometimes the AI completes quickly:

```
‚ö†Ô∏è Task failed (this may be normal for a simple observation task)
```

**What to do:**
1. Check the steps - did it accomplish what you asked?
2. Make the task more specific
3. Increase `maxSteps` if needed

### Browser doesn't open

**Install Playwright browsers:**
```bash
npx playwright install
```

### "API Key not found"

**Check your `.env.local`:**
```bash
cat .env.local | grep GEMINI_KEY
```

Should show:
```
GEMINI_KEY=AIza...
```

### Task is blocked incorrectly

**Review the blocked URL/content:**
```
üö® Blocked: PAYMENT BLOCKED: Page contains payment keyword: "$"
```

**Solution:** Adjust blocked keywords if it's a false positive. Edit [services/api/gemini-computer-use.ts](../services/api/gemini-computer-use.ts#L50)
