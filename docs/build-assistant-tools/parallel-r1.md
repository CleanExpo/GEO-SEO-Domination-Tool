# Parallel-R1 Documentation

## Overview
Parallel-R1 is a novel reinforcement learning (RL) framework designed to teach large language models "parallel thinking" for complex reasoning tasks, particularly in mathematical problem-solving.

## Purpose
Enable AI models to think in parallel paths, similar to how humans explore multiple solution approaches simultaneously when solving complex problems.
