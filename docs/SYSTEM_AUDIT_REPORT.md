# GEO-SEO CRM - System Audit Report
## Complete Analysis of Features, Bloat, and Optimization Opportunities

**Date**: 2025-01-07
**Purpose**: Identify and remove non-essential features that don't serve the core SEO business workflow

---

## Executive Summary

**Current State**: The application has significant feature bloat with many unused/unnecessary components that don't align with the core SEO workflow.

**Core Business Value**:
- SEO client management
- Automated audits (Lighthouse + E-E-A-T)
- Content calendar generation
- Keyword tracking
- Ranking monitoring
- AI-powered content optimization

**Recommendation**: Remove ~40-50% of current features to focus on SEO essentials.

## 🔴 REMOVE - High Priority (Unused/Unnecessary)

### 1. Traditional CRM Features (NOT SEO-focused)
**Impact**: These are generic CRM tools that don't serve SEO workflow

#### Pages to Remove:
- ❌ `app/crm/contacts/page.tsx` - Generic contact management
- ❌ `app/crm/deals/page.tsx` - Sales pipeline (not relevant)
- ❌ `app/crm/tasks/page.tsx` - Generic task manager
- ❌ `app/crm/calendar/page.tsx` - Generic calendar

**Reasoning**: Your CRM is for managing SEO clients, not traditional sales deals. Client management should be part of the Companies module.

#### API Routes to Remove:
- ❌ `app/api/crm/contacts/*` (4 routes)
- ❌ `app/api/crm/deals/*` (4 routes)
- ❌ `app/api/crm/tasks/*` (4 routes)
- ❌ `app/api/crm/calendar/*` (2 routes)

#### Database Tables to Remove:
- ❌ `contacts` (from crm_schema.sql)
- ❌ `deals` (from crm_schema.sql)
- ❌ `tasks` (from crm_schema.sql)
- ❌ `calendar_events` (from crm_schema.sql)

**Migration Path**: Keep contact info in Companies table with additional fields.

---

### 2. Developer Tools (Not Client-Facing)
**Impact**: These are internal dev tools that don't belong in production

#### Pages to Remove:
- ❌ `app/sandbox/page.tsx` - Generic sandbox
- ❌ `app/sandbox/_agents_disabled/page.tsx` - Disabled feature
- ❌ `app/jobs/page.tsx` - Job queue management (backend concern)
- ❌ `app/health/page.tsx` - Health check UI (use API directly)
- ❌ `app/guardian/page.tsx` - Internal monitoring
- ❌ `app/release/monitor/page.tsx` - Deployment monitoring
- ❌ `app/deploy/bluegreen/page.tsx` - Deployment tool
- ❌ `app/docs/api/page.tsx` - API documentation (move to external docs)

#### API Routes to Remove:
- ❌ `app/api/health/check/route.ts`
- ❌ `app/api/health/detailed/route.ts`
- ❌ `app/api/health/liveness/route.ts`
- ❌ `app/api/health/route.ts`
- ❌ `app/api/guardian/auto-fix/route.ts`
- ❌ `app/api/guardian/mcp-health/route.ts`
- ❌ `app/api/deploy/route.ts`
- ❌ `app/api/rollback/route.ts`
- ❌ `app/api/bluegreen/route.ts`
- ❌ `app/api/builds/route.ts`
- ❌ `app/api/apply/route.ts`
- ❌ `app/api/diff/route.ts`
- ❌ `app/api/link/route.ts`
- ❌ `app/api/sync/route.ts`

**Reasoning**: These are DevOps/monitoring tools. Use external monitoring services instead.

---

### 3. Disabled/Experimental Features
**Impact**: Dead code that should be completely removed

#### Pages/Routes to Delete:
- ❌ `app/_tactical_disabled/page.tsx`
- ❌ `app/api/_tactical_disabled/route.ts`
- ❌ `app/api/_agents_disabled/*` (3 routes)
- ❌ `app/api/_examples/guarded/route.ts`

**Reasoning**: If it's disabled, remove it. Don't keep dead code.

---

### 4. Generic Project Management (Not SEO-Specific)
**Impact**: Generic project tools that duplicate functionality

#### Pages to Remove or Consolidate:
- ⚠️ `app/projects/page.tsx` - Generic projects (keep for SEO campaigns only)
- ❌ `app/projects/autolink/page.tsx` - What is this?
- ❌ `app/projects/blueprints/page.tsx` - Code generation (not SEO-related)
- ❌ `app/projects/builds/page.tsx` - Build system (DevOps)
- ❌ `app/projects/catalog/page.tsx` - Unclear purpose
- ⚠️ `app/projects/github/page.tsx` - Keep if used for code audits
- ⚠️ `app/projects/notes/page.tsx` - Keep if used for client notes

#### Database Tables to Remove:
- ❌ `project_generation_templates` (from project-generation-schema.sql)
- ❌ `project_blueprints`
- ❌ `project_builds`

---

### 5. Redundant Resource Libraries
**Impact**: Nice-to-have but not essential

#### Pages to Remove or Consolidate:
- ❌ `app/resources/ai-tools/page.tsx` - List of external tools (link to docs instead)
- ❌ `app/resources/components/page.tsx` - Component library (for devs)
- ⚠️ `app/resources/prompts/page.tsx` - Keep if used for AI content generation
- ❌ `app/resources/tutorials/page.tsx` - External training content

#### API Routes to Remove:
- ❌ `app/api/resources/ai-tools/*` (2 routes)
- ❌ `app/api/resources/components/*` (2 routes)
- ❌ `app/api/resources/tutorials/*` (2 routes)

**Keep Only**: AI prompts library for content generation.

---

### 6. Unused Integration Tools
**Impact**: Third-party tools not being used

#### Routes to Evaluate:
- ⚠️ `app/api/integrations/firecrawl/*` - Are you using Firecrawl?
- ⚠️ `app/api/integrations/perplexity/*` - Duplicate of Claude features?
- ❌ `app/api/autolink/route.ts` - Unclear purpose
- ❌ `app/api/mcp/route.ts` - MCP server management (backend)

---

### 7. Multi-Tenancy Overhead (If Not Needed)
**Impact**: Complex org switching if you're managing all clients yourself

#### Pages to Evaluate:
- ⚠️ `app/[organisationId]/usage/page.tsx` - Multi-tenant usage tracking
- ❌ `app/api/organisations/list/route.ts`
- ❌ `app/api/organisations/switch/route.ts`
- ❌ `app/api/company/switch/route.ts`

**Question**: Are multiple users managing different organizations? If not, remove this complexity.

---

### 8. Authentication Bloat (If Using Supabase Auth)
**Impact**: Custom auth pages when Supabase handles it

#### Pages to Evaluate:
- ⚠️ `app/forgot-password/page.tsx` - Does Supabase handle this?
- ⚠️ `app/reset-password/page.tsx`
- ⚠️ `app/verify-email/page.tsx`
- ⚠️ `app/signup/page.tsx`
- ⚠️ `app/login/page.tsx`

**Recommendation**: Use Supabase Auth UI instead of custom pages.

---

### 9. Excessive Database Schemas
**Impact**: 58 SQL files with massive duplication

#### Files to Consolidate or Remove:
- ❌ All `SUPABASE-*` files (redundant with main schema)
- ❌ All `fix-*` files (migrations should be applied, not kept)
- ❌ `FULL_SCHEMA.sql`, `CLEAN_SCHEMA.sql`, `MINIMAL_SCHEMA.sql` (pick one!)
- ❌ `POSTGRES_SCHEMA.sql` vs `schema.sql` (consolidate)
- ❌ `TEST_RLS.sql` (testing, not production)

**Keep Only**:
1. One master schema file
2. Individual feature schemas (ai-search, onboarding, etc.)
3. Active migration files (with version numbers)

---

## 🟡 EVALUATE - Medium Priority (May or May Not Be Useful)

### 1. AI Strategy Pages
- ⚠️ `app/ai-strategy/page.tsx`
- ⚠️ `app/ai-visibility/page.tsx`

**Question**: Are these being used for client SEO strategies? If yes, keep. If no, remove.

### 2. Analytics/Reporting
- ⚠️ `app/analytics/page.tsx`

**Question**: Does this show client SEO analytics? If yes, keep and enhance. If it's generic analytics, remove.

### 3. Support Features
- ⚠️ `app/support/page.tsx`
- ⚠️ `app/api/support/contact/route.ts`

**Recommendation**: Keep if clients use it. Otherwise, use external support system.

### 4. Settings/Integrations
- ⚠️ `app/settings/page.tsx`
- ⚠️ `app/settings/integrations/page.tsx`

**Recommendation**: Keep settings, but only for API keys and SEO tool integrations.
