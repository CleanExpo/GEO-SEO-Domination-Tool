## What is Claude Code?

Claude Code is an AI-powered coding assistant that works directly in your terminal, providing comprehensive support for building, debugging, and maintaining codebases.

## Key Features

### 1. Build Features
- **Plain English to Code**: Converts natural language descriptions into functional, production-ready code
- **Implementation Planning**: Creates detailed plans before writing code
- **Functionality Assurance**: Ensures code works as intended before completion

### 2. Debugging Capabilities
- **Codebase Analysis**: Deeply analyzes entire projects to identify issues
- **Fix Implementation**: Implements fixes for reported problems
- **Thoughtful Resolution**: Provides context-aware problem solving

### 3. Codebase Navigation
- **Project Structure Awareness**: Maintains understanding of entire codebase
- **External Integration**: Retrieves information from Google Drive, Figma, Slack, etc.
- **Complex Query Handling**: Answers detailed questions about project architecture

### 4. Automation Tools
- **Lint Resolution**: Automatically resolves linting issues
- **Merge Conflict Handling**: Assists with Git merge conflicts
- **Release Notes Generation**: Creates comprehensive release documentation
- **CI/CD Support**: Integrates with deployment workflows

## Unique Advantages

### Direct Action
- Works directly in terminal (not just chat)
- Edits files, runs commands, executes tests
- Takes action without requiring copy-paste

### Composable & Scriptable
- Can be called from scripts
- Supports automation workflows
- Integrates with existing tools

### Enterprise Ready
- Robust security
- Compliance support
- Production-grade reliability

## Technical Requirements

- **Node.js**: Version 18 or newer
- **Account**: Claude.ai or Claude Console account
- **Installation**:
  ```bash
  npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
  ```

## Deployment Options

### Terminal-Based
```bash
claude
claude -p "Convert this to TypeScript"
claude -c  # Continue previous conversation
```

### VS Code Extension (Beta)
- Integrated IDE experience
- Inline suggestions
- File editing

### Cloud Hosting
- AWS deployment
- GCP support
- Custom hosting

## How Claude Code Works

### 1. Context Gathering
- Reads project files
- Understands dependencies
- Maps architecture

### 2. Planning
- Creates implementation strategy
- Identifies affected files
- Plans testing approach

### 3. Execution
- Writes/edits code
- Runs tests
- Verifies functionality

### 4. Validation
- Ensures code quality
- Checks for errors
- Validates against requirements

## Best Practices

### For Building
1. **Be Specific**: Provide clear requirements
2. **Show Examples**: Reference existing code patterns
3. **Define Success**: Explain what "working" means

### For Debugging
1. **Describe Symptoms**: Explain what's broken
2. **Show Error Messages**: Include full stack traces
3. **Provide Context**: Explain expected behavior

### For Navigation
1. **Ask Specific Questions**: "Where is user auth handled?"
2. **Request Patterns**: "Show me all API routes"
3. **Seek Understanding**: "How does data flow?"

## Advanced Capabilities

### Tool Use
Claude Code can:
- Execute bash commands
- Read/write files

## Integration with Tom

Tom leverages Claude Code's capabilities to provide:
- **Systematic Validation**: Using Claude's codebase understanding
- **Automated Testing**: Leveraging tool execution
- **Intelligent Analysis**: Deep pattern recognition
- **Fix Recommendations**: Context-aware suggestions

## Security & Privacy

- Code stays local (unless explicitly shared)
- API calls encrypted
- No training on your code
- Compliance-ready architecture

## Performance

- Efficient codebase scanning
- Optimized for large projects
- Handles monorepos

## Limitations

- Requires internet connection (for API calls)
- Node.js dependency
- Terminal or VS Code required
- API rate limits apply

## Getting Help

- Documentation: https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code
- GitHub Issues: Report bugs and feature requests
- Discord Community: Ask questions, share tips
- Support: Enterprise support available

## Future Roadmap

- More IDE integrations
- Enhanced automation
- Better multi-file refactoring
- Improved error detection
- Faster execution
