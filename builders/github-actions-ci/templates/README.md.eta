# GitHub Actions CI

**ci.yml** runs typecheck/lint/build on pushes and PRs to `main`.

**docker-publish.yml** builds + pushes Docker image when **REGISTRY** and **IMAGE_NAME** are set in the workflow template and registry credentials exist as secrets:
- `REGISTRY_USERNAME` / `REGISTRY_PASSWORD` (generic)
- or `GHCR_PAT` (GitHub Container Registry PAT)

Update variables in the builder or edit after apply.
