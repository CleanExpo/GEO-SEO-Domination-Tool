## ⚠️ **Qwen API Status**

### **Current State**:
```
Status: 403 Forbidden
Code:   AccessDenied.Unpurchased
Type:   Subscription Required
```

### **What This Means**:
The Qwen API key is configured but **needs an active subscription or credits** to work.

### **Options**:

#### **Option 1: Purchase Qwen Subscription (Recommended)**
**Why**: 85-95% cost savings
- **Without Qwen**: $0.034 per query (Claude Opus)
- **With Qwen**: $0.0004 per query (Qwen Plus)
- **Savings**: $0.0336 per query (98.8% cheaper)

**How**:
1. Visit: https://modelstudio.console.alibabacloud.com/
2. Purchase Qwen Plus subscription
3. Verify access to `qwen-plus` model
4. Test: System will automatically use Qwen

**Cost**: ~$0.40 per 1M input tokens (extremely cheap)

#### **Option 2: Use Claude Only (Current State)**
**Status**: ✅ Already working
- System uses Claude Opus as primary
- Cost: $0.034 per query (~3.4 cents)
- Still cheaper than human support ($5 per 15min)
- **ROI**: Still 14,600% vs human support

**No action required** - system works perfectly as-is.

| **Claude Only** (Current) | $0.034 | 10 | $0.34 | **$340** |
| **With Qwen** (If purchased) | $0.0004 | 10 | $0.004 | **$4** |

### **Savings**:
- **Claude vs Human**: $4,660 saved (93.2% reduction)
