# 🔴 CRITICAL: DEV SERVER RESTART REQUIRED 🔴

## ⚠️ IMMEDIATE ACTION NEEDED

The onboarding save feature has been **FIXED**, but the changes will **NOT** take effect until you **RESTART THE DEV SERVER**.

## What Was Fixed?

### 1. Database Method Calls (✅ Fixed)
- Changed incorrect `db.get()` and `db.run()` to correct `db.queryOne()` and `db.query()`
- File: `app/api/onboarding/save/route.ts`

### 2. Webpack Configuration (✅ Fixed)
- Added `better-sqlite3` to webpack externals in `next.config.js`
- **This requires dev server restart to take effect!**

## 🚀 How to Restart Dev Server

### Step 1: Stop Current Server
In the terminal where dev server is running:
- Press `Ctrl+C` (or `Cmd+C` on Mac)
- Wait for server to fully stop

### Step 2: Start Dev Server
```bash
npm run dev
```

### Step 3: Wait for Compilation
Wait for the message:
```
✓ Ready in [time]ms
○ Local: http://localhost:3001
```

## 🧪 How to Test After Restart

### Quick Test (Browser)
1. Navigate to: http://localhost:3001/onboarding/new
2. Fill in:
   - Business Name: "Test Company"
   - Email: "test@example.com"
   - Contact Name: "Test User"
3. Click **Save** button
4. You should see: ✅ "Progress Saved!" toast
5. Refresh the page
6. Click **Load** button
7. Enter same Business Name and Email
8. You should see: ✅ "Progress Loaded!" toast with form populated

### Automated Test (Terminal)
After restarting dev server, run:
```bash
npm run test:onboarding-complete
```

**Expected Output**:
```
Test 1: Database Connection               ✓
Test 2: saved_onboarding Table Existence   ✓
Test 3: POST /api/onboarding/save          ✓
Test 4: GET /api/onboarding/save           ✓
Test 5: Database Persistence Verification  ✓

✓ ALL TESTS PASSED!
```

## 🔍 What Changed (Technical Details)

### Files Modified
1. **app/api/onboarding/save/route.ts**
   - Fixed database method calls
   - Added explicit `db.initialize()` calls
   - Both POST and GET endpoints updated

2. **next.config.js**
   - Added `'better-sqlite3'` to webpack externals
   - **Requires restart to take effect**

3. **package.json**
   - Added test scripts for verification

### Files Created
1. **scripts/test-saved-onboarding.js** - Direct database test
2. **scripts/test-api-direct.js** - API endpoint test
3. **scripts/test-onboarding-complete.js** - Full integration test
4. **app/test-save/page.tsx** - Browser test page
5. **ONBOARDING_SAVE_FIX.md** - Detailed fix documentation

## 🐛 If Tests Still Fail After Restart

### 1. Check Server Console
Look for error messages in the terminal where dev server is running

### 2. Verify Database Table
```bash
npm run test:saved-onboarding
```

Should show:
```
✓ saved_onboarding table exists
✓ Insert successful!
✓ Select successful!
```

### 3. Test API Directly
```bash
npm run test:onboarding-api
```

Should return status 200 (not 500)

### 4. Check Browser Console
Open DevTools (F12) and check for JavaScript errors

### 5. Clear Next.js Cache
```bash
# Stop dev server first
rm -rf .next
npm run dev
```

## 📞 Support

If issues persist after restart:
1. Check `ONBOARDING_SAVE_FIX.md` for detailed debugging
2. Run: `npm run test:onboarding-complete` and share output
3. Check server console logs for specific error messages
4. Verify all test scripts pass individually

## ✅ Success Indicators

After restart, you should see:
- ✅ No 500 Internal Server Error
- ✅ "Progress Saved!" toast notification
- ✅ "Progress Loaded!" toast notification
- ✅ Form data persists across page reloads
- ✅ Auto-save works after 3 seconds
