# Load Button Fix - Case-Insensitive Search

**Issue:** Load button shows "No saved data found" even when data exists in database.

**Root Cause:** Exact string matching required business name and email to match **exactly** including:
- Case sensitivity (Disaster Recovery ‚â† disaster recovery)
- Trailing whitespace ("Disaster Recovery " ‚â† "Disaster Recovery")

## Solution Implemented

Updated [app/api/onboarding/save/route.ts:121-127](app/api/onboarding/save/route.ts#L121-L127) to use flexible matching:

```sql
SELECT form_data, current_step, last_saved, business_name, email
FROM saved_onboarding
WHERE LOWER(TRIM(business_name)) = LOWER(TRIM(?))
AND LOWER(TRIM(email)) = LOWER(TRIM(?))
```

This makes the search:
- **Case-insensitive**: "disaster recovery" = "Disaster Recovery" = "DISASTER RECOVERY"
- **Whitespace-tolerant**: "  Disaster Recovery  " = "Disaster Recovery"

## Test Results (Direct Database)

‚úÖ All variations now find the record:

```
‚úÖ "disaster recovery" (lowercase) ‚Üí FOUND
‚úÖ "Disaster Recovery" (proper case) ‚Üí FOUND
‚úÖ "DISASTER RECOVERY" (uppercase) ‚Üí FOUND
‚úÖ "  Disaster Recovery  " (extra whitespace) ‚Üí FOUND
```

## Before vs After

### Before (Exact Match Required)
```
User enters: "disaster recovery"
Database has: "Disaster Recovery "
Result: ‚ùå NOT FOUND (different case + trailing space)
```

### After (Flexible Matching)
```
User enters: "disaster recovery"
Database has: "Disaster Recovery "
Result: ‚úÖ FOUND (case-insensitive, whitespace trimmed)
```

## How to Test

### 1. Deploy the changes

```bash
git add app/api/onboarding/save/route.ts
git commit -m "fix: Make Load button search case-insensitive and trim whitespace"
git push
```

### 2. Test in production

Go to: https://geo-seo-domination-tool.vercel.app/onboarding/new

Click "Load" button and try **any of these**:
- Business: `disaster recovery` (lowercase)
- Business: `Disaster Recovery` (proper case)
- Business: `DISASTER RECOVERY` (uppercase)

Email: `phill@disasterrecovery.com.au` (any case)

All should work! ‚úÖ

### 3. Verify with test script (after deployment)

```bash
node scripts/test-api-load-flexible.mjs
```

Expected: All 4 test cases should return `‚úÖ FOUND`

## Additional Improvements

Also added debug logging to help troubleshoot future issues:

**When NOT FOUND:**
```json
{
  "found": false,
  "message": "No saved progress found",
  "searchedFor": {
    "businessName": "disaster recovery",
    "email": "phill@disasterrecovery.com.au"
  }
}
```

**Server logs when FOUND:**
```
[Load] Found saved data for: {
  businessName: 'Disaster Recovery ',
  email: 'phill@disasterrecovery.com.au'
}
```

## Database Records

Current production records (5 total):

| Business Name | Email | Can Load With |
|---------------|-------|---------------|
| Disaster Recovery  | phill@disasterrecovery.com.au | ‚úÖ Any case variation |
| Pre-Debug Check | check@example.com | ‚úÖ Any case variation |
| Browser Scrape Test | scrape@example.com | ‚úÖ Any case variation |
| Test Business | test@example.com | ‚úÖ Any case variation |
| REAL FIX TEST | realfix@test.com | ‚úÖ Any case variation |

## Files Modified

- [app/api/onboarding/save/route.ts](app/api/onboarding/save/route.ts) - Updated GET endpoint with flexible search
- [components/onboarding/ClientIntakeForm.tsx](components/onboarding/ClientIntakeForm.tsx) - Added debug logging (from previous fix)

## Files Created

- `scripts/test-case-insensitive-load.mjs` - Direct database test
- `scripts/test-api-load-flexible.mjs` - API endpoint test
- `LOAD_BUTTON_FIX.md` - This documentation

## Next Steps

1. ‚úÖ Commit and push changes
2. ‚úÖ Wait for Vercel deployment (~2 minutes)
3. ‚úÖ Test Load button with any case variation
4. ‚úÖ Verify form fields populate correctly

---

**Expected User Experience After Fix:**

1. User clicks "Load" button
2. Enters business name (any case, with/without spaces)
3. Enters email (any case)
4. ‚úÖ Data loads successfully
5. ‚úÖ Form fields populate with saved information
6. ‚úÖ Toast shows "Progress Loaded! Resumed from step X of 5"

**No more "No saved data found" errors due to case/whitespace mismatch!** üéâ
