## Key Capabilities Designed

### 1. In-CRM Terminal
- **WebSocket PTY server** for cross-platform terminal emulation
- **Command validation** to prevent shell injection attacks
- **Session persistence** with command history stored in database
- **Real-time output streaming** to CRM interface

### 2. Live Preview Panel ("Second Screen")
- **Hot Module Replacement (HMR)** for instant code updates
- **Error boundary overlay** for debugging
- **Console log forwarding** to CRM
- **Network request monitoring** for API calls
- **Responsive iframe** or popup window display

### 3. GitHub Import/Fork Automation
- **One-click repository cloning** via GitHub API
- **Dependency analysis** and conflict detection
- **Auto-resolution** of version conflicts
- **Git submodule integration** for clean version control

### 4. Vercel Preview Deployment
- **Automated deployment** to Vercel preview environment
- **Build log streaming** to CRM
- **Preview URL generation** with instant access
- **Environment variable management**

### 5. Multi-Model AI Routing

**Routing Logic:**
```javascript
const routingRules = {
  complexity: "high" => GPT-5 Codex ($1.50/task),
  complexity: "medium" => Claude Code ($0.15/task),
  complexity: "low" => DeepSeek V3-Exp ($0.01/task),
  type: "documentation" => SpecKit (Free),
  type: "multimodal" => Qwen3-Omni ($0.06/query)
}
```

**Cost Savings:**
- Without routing: $1,500/month (1000 tasks to GPT-5)
- With routing: $378/month (smart distribution)
- **Savings: 75%**

## Integration with Qwen3-Omni

### Voice-to-Code Workflow

```
User (voice): "Build me a keyword research widget"
  ↓
Qwen3-Omni Instruct → Understands intent and extracts parameters
  ↓
Router Agent → Selects Builder Agent (Claude Code)
  ↓
Builder Agent → Generates React component code
  ↓
Live Preview Agent → Renders in "Second Screen"
  ↓
Qwen3-Omni Talker → "I've created the widget. It includes voice input
                      using Web Speech API and integrates with SEMrush
                      for keyword data. Would you like me to deploy it?"
```

### Video-to-Code Workflow

```
User uploads competitor website tour video (5 minutes)
  ↓
Qwen3-Omni Captioner → Analyzes video frame-by-frame
  ↓
Extracts UI patterns, color schemes, animations, layout structure
  ↓
UI-Navigation Agent → Scaffolds similar layout with improvements
  ↓
Builder Agent → Implements interactive components
  ↓
Live Preview Agent → Shows recreated design
  ↓
Qwen3-Omni Talker → "I've recreated their homepage design with improved
                      mobile responsiveness and accessibility features."
```

### Real-Time Code Review

```
User (voice): "Review the code I just wrote"
  ↓
Builder Agent → Analyzes code quality, security, performance
  ↓
Qwen3-Omni Thinking → Deep reasoning about potential issues
  ↓
Qwen3-Omni Talker → (Natural speech)
  "I found three issues. First, the database query on line 47 is
   vulnerable to SQL injection. You should use parameterized queries.
   Second, the useEffect hook has a missing dependency which will
   cause infinite re-renders. Third, the API call doesn't handle
   errors gracefully. Shall I fix these for you?"
  ↓
User (voice): "Yes, fix them"
  ↓
Builder Agent → Auto-fixes issues → Updates live preview
```

## Security Measures

### 1. Sandbox Isolation
- **Docker containers** for each session
- **Resource limits:** 1 CPU, 1GB memory per container
- **Network isolation:** No access to internal network
- **Read-only filesystem** except `/workspace`
- **Time limits:** Max 10 minutes per command

### 2. Command Injection Prevention
```typescript
const DANGEROUS_COMMANDS = [
  'rm -rf', 'dd if=', 'mkfs', ':(){ :|:& };:', 'sudo', 'su', 'chmod 777'
]

const ALLOWED_COMMANDS = [
  'npm', 'npx', 'node', 'git', 'ls', 'cd', 'pwd', 'cat', 'echo'
]

export function validateCommand(command: string): boolean {
  // Block dangerous patterns
  if (DANGEROUS_COMMANDS.some(dangerous => command.includes(dangerous))) {
    throw new Error('Dangerous command detected')
  }

  // Whitelist base commands
  const baseCommand = command.trim().split(' ')[0]
  if (!ALLOWED_COMMANDS.includes(baseCommand)) {
    throw new Error(`Command not allowed: ${baseCommand}`)
  }

  // No shell metacharacters
  if (/[;&|`$()]/.test(command)) {
    throw new Error('Shell metacharacters not allowed')
  }

  return true
}
```

### 3. API Key Management
- **Server-side encryption** using AES-256
- **No client-side exposure** of API keys
- **Proxy requests** through backend
- **Automatic rotation** every 90 days
