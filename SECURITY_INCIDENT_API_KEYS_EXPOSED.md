# SECURITY INCIDENT: API Keys Exposed in Git History

## Date: October 8, 2025
## Severity: HIGH
## Status: REQUIRES IMMEDIATE ACTION

## Summary
Four API keys were accidentally committed to the public GitHub repository in commit `0bd769f` (file: `MCP_SETUP_GUIDE.md`) on October 8, 2025 at 21:49 AEST. While the keys were removed in subsequent commit `eb6b019`, they remain in the git history and are publicly visible.

## Exposed API Keys

### 1. ✅ Google API Key (CONFIRMED EXPOSED TO GOOGLE)
**Key**: `AIzaSyD...24zZi8` (REDACTED - already revoked)
**Service**: Google Maps API / Google Cloud Platform
**Status**: **REVOKED BY USER** (Google sent security notification)
**Action Required**: ✅ ALREADY DELETED BY USER

### 2. ⚠️ Perplexity API Key
**Key**: `pplx-EoO...dDm6` (REDACTED - already rotated)
**Service**: Perplexity AI
**Exposed Time**: ~6 hours (21:49 - present)
**Action Required**:
1. Go to https://www.perplexity.ai/settings/api
2. Delete the exposed key immediately
3. Generate new API key
4. Update in `.env.local` and Vercel environment variables

### 3. ⚠️ GitHub Personal Access Token
**Key**: `ghp_fqu...0sM9Ef` (REDACTED - already rotated)
**Service**: GitHub (Classic PAT)
**Scopes**: admin:public_key, gist, read:org, repo, workflow
**Exposed Time**: ~6 hours
**Risk**: HIGH - Full repo access, workflow modification, gist creation
**Action Required**:
1. Go to https://github.com/settings/tokens
2. Revoke token ending in `...0sM9Ef`
3. Generate new classic PAT with same scopes:
   - admin:public_key
   - gist
   - read:org
   - repo
   - workflow
4. Update in `.env.local` and Vercel

### 4. ⚠️ Supabase Anon Key
**Key**: `eyJhbGc...vfD8o` (REDACTED - anon key, safe for public if RLS enabled)
**Service**: Supabase (Project: `qwoggbbavikzhypzodcr`)
**Type**: Anon/Public Key (designed for client-side use)
**Risk**: MEDIUM - Anon keys are safe for public exposure if RLS policies are properly configured
**Recommendation**:
- Check Row Level Security (RLS) policies on all tables
- If RLS is properly configured: Key can remain (it's designed to be public)
- If RLS is NOT configured: Rotate immediately via Supabase dashboard

## Git Commits Affected

**Commit with exposed keys**:
- Hash: `0bd769f6a8a33c366af3fe16568ec28e27920e33`
- Date: Wed Oct 8 21:49:34 2025 +1000

## Immediate Actions Required

### Priority 1 - Critical (Do Immediately)
1. ✅ **Google API Key**: Already deleted
2. ⚠️ **GitHub Token**: Revoke at https://github.com/settings/tokens
3. ⚠️ **Perplexity Key**: Delete at https://www.perplexity.ai/settings/api

### Priority 2 - High (Do Today)
4. **Supabase Key**: Evaluate RLS policies, rotate if needed

### Priority 3 - Cleanup (Do This Week)
5. **Git History Cleanup**: Consider using `git filter-branch` or BFG Repo-Cleaner to remove keys from history
6. **Force Push**: After cleanup, force push to overwrite history (WARNING: Coordinate with team first)

## Step-by-Step Key Rotation

### Perplexity AI
```bash
# 1. Go to Perplexity settings
open https://www.perplexity.ai/settings/api

# 2. Delete old key ending in "...dDm6"
# 3. Click "Create new API Key"
# 4. Copy the new key
# 5. Update locally
echo "PERPLEXITY_API_KEY=pplx-YOUR-NEW-KEY-HERE" >> .env.local

# 6. Update in Vercel
vercel env rm PERPLEXITY_API_KEY production
vercel env add PERPLEXITY_API_KEY production
# Paste new key when prompted

# 7. Redeploy
vercel --prod
```

### GitHub Personal Access Token
```bash
# 1. Revoke old token
open https://github.com/settings/tokens

# 2. Click on token ending in "...0sM9Ef" → Delete
# 3. Generate new token:
#    - Click "Generate new token (classic)"
#    - Note: "GEO-SEO Tool Access"
#    - Expiration: No expiration (or 90 days for better security)
#    - Scopes: admin:public_key, gist, read:org, repo, workflow
#    - Generate token

# 4. Copy the new token immediately (can't view again)

# 5. Update locally
echo "GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp_YOUR-NEW-TOKEN-HERE" >> .env.local

# 6. Update in Vercel
vercel env rm GITHUB_TOKEN production
vercel env add GITHUB_TOKEN production
# Paste new token

# 7. Update in .claude/mcp.json (local only, not committed)
# Edit .claude/mcp.json and replace GITHUB_TOKEN value
```

### Supabase (If RLS not configured)
```bash
# 1. Go to Supabase project settings
open https://app.supabase.com/project/qwoggbbavikzhypzodcr/settings/api

# 2. Under "Project API keys" → Click "Reset" on anon/public key
# 3. Copy new key
# 4. Update locally and in Vercel (same process as above)

# Better solution: Configure RLS properly instead
# Go to: https://app.supabase.com/project/qwoggbbavikzhypzodcr/auth/policies
# Add RLS policies to all tables
```

## Prevention Measures

### Implemented
1. ✅ Added `.claude/mcp.json` to `.gitignore`
2. ✅ Replaced real keys with placeholders in documentation
3. ✅ Added security warnings in MCP_SETUP_GUIDE.md

### Recommended
1. **Pre-commit Hook**: Install `git-secrets` or `truffleHog` to scan for secrets
2. **GitHub Secret Scanning**: Enable for repository (if not already)
3. **Environment Variables Only**: Never hardcode keys, always use `.env` files
4. **.env Files in .gitignore**: Verify `.env`, `.env.local`, `.env.development` are ignored
5. **Code Review**: Always review diffs before committing

## Timeline
- **21:49 AEST**: Keys committed to `MCP_SETUP_GUIDE.md` (commit 0bd769f)
- **21:49 AEST**: Keys removed and replaced with placeholders (commit eb6b019)
- **~03:30 AEST (next day)**: Google sent security alert to user
- **Present**: Creating this incident report
