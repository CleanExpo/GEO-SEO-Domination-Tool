   - App type: **"script"** (CRITICAL!)
   - Name: GEO-SEO Content Mining Tool
   - Redirect URI: http://localhost:3000

2. **Copy your credentials:**
   - Client ID (14 characters)
   - Client Secret (27 characters)

### Step 2: Update Your .env.local File (1 minute)

Open `.env.local` and replace these lines with your actual credentials:

```env
# Current placeholders in your file:
REDDIT_CLIENT_ID=your_14_char_client_id_here
REDDIT_CLIENT_SECRET=your_27_char_secret_here
REDDIT_USERNAME=your_reddit_username
REDDIT_PASSWORD=your_reddit_password
REDDIT_USER_AGENT=geo-seo-tool/1.0 by your-reddit-username

# Replace with YOUR actual values:
REDDIT_CLIENT_ID=AbCdEfGhIjKlMn              # ← Your 14-char ID
REDDIT_CLIENT_SECRET=AbCdEfGhIjKlMnOpQrSt    # ← Your 27-char secret
REDDIT_USERNAME=your-reddit-username          # ← Your Reddit username
REDDIT_PASSWORD=your-secure-password          # ← Your Reddit password
REDDIT_USER_AGENT=geo-seo-tool/1.0 by your-reddit-username  # ← Update username
```

### Step 3: Test with Your First Keyword (3 minutes)

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Reddit API authentication failed"

**Check these:**
1. Client ID is exactly 14 characters
2. Client Secret is exactly 27 characters  
3. App type is "script" (not "web app")
4. Username and password are correct
5. User agent format: `app-name/version by your-username`

### Issue: "No opportunities found"

**Try:**
1. More specific keywords: "water damage insurance claim Brisbane" vs "water damage"
2. Lower the minScore parameter to 0
3. Check if keyword has search volume in DataForSEO
4. Verify DATAFORSEO_API_KEY is set and valid

### Issue: "Content generation failed"

**Verify:**
1. ANTHROPIC_API_KEY is set in `.env.local` ✅ (I see you have it)
2. Claude API has available quota
3. Opportunity has `top_questions` data (Reddit search succeeded)

## 💡 Pro Tips

### Best Keywords to Start With
✅ **Good examples:**
- "mould removal insurance claim Brisbane"
- "water damage restoration cost"
- "flood cleanup emergency Sydney"

❌ **Avoid:**
- Too broad: "water damage"
- No commercial intent: "what is mould"
- No search volume: ultra-specific phrases

### Targeting Specific Subreddits
Instead of `["all"]`, try:
```json
{
  "subreddits": ["HomeImprovement", "Insurance", "DIY", "Plumbing"],
  "topN": 10
}
```

### Rate Limiting Best Practices
- Start with 10-15 keywords per batch
- Analyze 15-25 Reddit threads per keyword
- Reddit limit: 60 requests/minute
- Add delays if processing 50+ keywords
