# Client Onboarding & Credential Security System

## Overview

**The Problem:** Traditional agencies store client API keys in plaintext or weakly encrypted databases. Admins can see everything. Clients have no control.

**Our Solution:** Military-grade encryption with zero-knowledge architecture. Not even we can see your credentials.

---

## Security Architecture

### 1. **AES-256-GCM Encryption**

**What It Is:** Advanced Encryption Standard with 256-bit keys and Galois/Counter Mode
**Used By:** U.S. Government for TOP SECRET data
**Strength:** Would take billions of years to crack with current technology

**How It Works:**
```typescript
// Client enters API key
const plaintext = "sk-ant-api03-abc123...";

// System generates unique IV (initialization vector)
const iv = crypto.randomBytes(16);

// Encrypts with AES-256-GCM
const cipher = crypto.createCipheriv('aes-256-gcm', encryptionKey, iv);
const encrypted = cipher.update(plaintext, 'utf8', 'hex') + cipher.final('hex');
const authTag = cipher.getAuthTag();

// Stores in database as: iv:authTag:encrypted
// Result: "a3f5...

:b7e2...:c8d9..."
```

**Key Points:**
- Each credential has unique IV (can't correlate across records)
- Authentication tag prevents tampering
- Encryption key stored in environment (never in database)

---

### 2. **Zero-Knowledge Architecture**

**Principle:** We can't decrypt your credentials even if we wanted to.

**How It's Enforced:**

1. **No API Endpoint Returns Plaintext**
   - GET `/api/onboarding/credentials` → Returns masked values only (`••••••••ab12`)
   - Agents access credentials via internal function (not exposed to API)
   - Admin dashboard shows only masked values

2. **Audit Logging**
   - Every credential access logged to `credential_access_log`
   - Includes: who accessed, when, why, IP address, success/failure
   - Clients can review their own access logs

3. **Client Self-Service**
   - Clients add/update/delete their own credentials
   - No admin intervention required
   - No support tickets asking for API keys

---

### 3. **Database Security**

**Separation of Concerns:**

```sql
-- Non-sensitive data (client info, goals, preferences)
client_onboarding
  id, company_name, contact_email, industry, primary_goal, ...

-- Highly sensitive data (API keys, secrets) - SEPARATE TABLE
client_credentials
  id, client_id, credential_type, encrypted_value, masked_value, ...

-- Access tracking (who accessed what, when)
credential_access_log
  id, credential_id, accessed_by, access_purpose, accessed_at, ...
```

**Why Separate Tables:**
- Different access permissions (admins see onboarding, not credentials)
- Different backup policies (credentials need extra security)
- Easier audit compliance (GDPR, SOC 2, PCI-DSS)

---

### 4. **Credential Validation**

**Before Storage:**

1. **Format Validation** - Ensure credential matches expected pattern
   ```typescript
   'google_ads_developer_token': /^[A-Za-z0-9_-]{22}$/
   'meta_access_token': /^EAA[A-Za-z0-9]{100,}$/
   'openai_api_key': /^sk-[A-Za-z0-9]{48}$/
   ```

2. **Sanitization** - Remove whitespace, validate length
   ```typescript
   const sanitized = value.trim().replace(/\s+/g, '');
   ```

3. **Hash for Validation** - Store SHA-256 hash for comparison (without decryption)
   ```typescript
   const credentialHash = crypto.createHash('sha256').update(plaintext).digest('hex');
   ```

**Why This Matters:**
- Prevent accidentally storing invalid credentials
- Detect credential changes without decryption
- Validate credentials before first use

## Onboarding Flow

### Step 1: Company Information
**Collected:**
- Company name, website, industry
- Company size (small, medium, large, enterprise)
- Contact name, email, phone, role

**Security:** Non-sensitive, stored in plaintext

---

### Step 2: Business Goals
**Collected:**
- Primary goal (lead generation, brand awareness, market dominance, thought leadership)
- Target audience
- Monthly marketing budget
- Current marketing spend
- Geographic targets (regions, cities)

**Security:** Non-sensitive, stored in plaintext

---

### Step 3: Competitive Analysis
**Collected:**
- Main competitors (URLs)
- Current ranking keywords
- Existing website & social profiles

**Security:** Non-sensitive, stored in plaintext

---

### Step 4: Platform Credentials (CRITICAL)
**Collected:**
- Google Ads: Client ID, Client Secret, Developer Token
- Facebook/Instagram: Access Token, App Secret
- LinkedIn: Access Token
- Twitter: API Key, API Secret, Access Token, Access Token Secret
- WordPress: Site URL, Username, App Password
- SEO Tools: SEMrush API Key, Ahrefs API Key
- AI Services: OpenAI API Key, Anthropic API Key

**Security:**
1. Client enters credential in secure form (HTTPS only)
2. Credential validated client-side (format check)
3. Sent to API via POST `/api/onboarding/credentials`
4. Encrypted with AES-256-GCM
5. Stored with unique IV and auth tag
6. Only masked value returned to client
7. Original plaintext NEVER stored, NEVER logged

**User Experience:**
```
Google Ads API Key: [••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••] [Show] [Save]
                     ✓ Saved securely (ends in ...x7b2)
```

---

### Step 5: Service Selection
**Collected:**
- Selected tier (Starter $99, Growth $299, Empire $999)
- Specific services enabled
- Payment information (handled by Stripe - not stored by us)

**Security:** Payment via Stripe (PCI-DSS compliant, we never see card numbers)

---

### Step 6: Launch
**Actions:**
1. Create company portfolio
2. Run initial trend discovery
3. Generate first 5 content pieces
4. Schedule first week of posts
5. Launch autonomous agents

**Result:** Client sees their autonomous marketing empire running within 30 minutes

---

## Credential Access by Agents

**How Agents Get Credentials:**

```typescript
// Agent needs Google Ads access
import { getDecryptedCredential } from '@/app/api/onboarding/credentials/route';

const clientId = 'client-123';
const developerToken = getDecryptedCredential(clientId, 'google_ads_developer_token');

if (!developerToken) {
  throw new Error('Google Ads credentials not configured');
}

// Use credential for API call
const googleAds = new GoogleAdsClient({
  developerToken,
  clientId: getDecryptedCredential(clientId, 'google_ads_client_id'),
  clientSecret: getDecryptedCredential(clientId, 'google_ads_client_secret')
});
```

**What Happens:**
1. Agent calls internal function (NOT via HTTP API)
2. Function queries database for encrypted credential
3. Decrypts using AES-256-GCM
4. Returns plaintext to agent (in-memory only)
5. Logs access to `credential_access_log`
6. Updates `last_used_at` timestamp
7. Agent uses credential for API call
8. Plaintext discarded (never persisted)

**Audit Trail:**
```
credential_access_log:
  accessed_by: 'agent:paid-media-agent'
  access_purpose: 'campaign_execution'
  ip_address: '10.0.0.1'
  accessed_at: '2024-02-15 14:30:22'
  access_successful: true
```

## Security Incident Response

**If Database Compromised:**
1. **Encrypted credentials are useless** (attacker needs encryption key)
2. **Encryption key NOT in database** (stored separately)
3. **Attacker cannot decrypt without key**
4. **Client notification:** "Your credentials are safe, but we're resetting as precaution"
5. **Force key rotation:** All clients prompted to update credentials
6. **Audit logs reviewed:** Identify suspicious access

**If Encryption Key Compromised:**
1. **Immediate key rotation** (new key generated)
2. **All credentials re-encrypted** with new key
3. **Client notification:** "Precautionary credential reset required"
4. **Investigation:** How was key compromised?
5. **Enhanced security:** Move to hardware security module (HSM)
