### Step 3: Watch the Swarm Activate! 🤖

Once created, the system will automatically:

1. ✅ **Create Portfolio** in database
2. 🔄 **Trigger Initial Audit** (Audit Swarm activates)
   - SEO Audit Agent analyzes website
   - Social Media Audit Agent checks all platforms
   - Results aggregated and scored
3. 🔄 **Log Autonomous Actions** for optimization
4. 🔄 **Begin Deep Research** (coming next)

---

## 📊 Check Audit Results

After the audit completes (30-60 seconds), query the database:

```bash
# Using Node.js (create a simple script)
node -e "
const Database = require('better-sqlite3');
const db = new Database('./data/geo-seo.db');
const audits = db.prepare('SELECT * FROM portfolio_audits ORDER BY completed_at DESC LIMIT 1').all();
console.log(JSON.stringify(audits, null, 2));
db.close();
"
```

Or use any SQLite viewer to see:
- `company_portfolios` - Your Unite Group portfolio
- `portfolio_audits` - Audit results with scores
- `autonomous_actions` - Scheduled optimization actions
- `swarm_coordination` - Agent orchestration logs
