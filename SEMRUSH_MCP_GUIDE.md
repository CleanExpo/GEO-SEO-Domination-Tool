## API Unit Consumption

Semrush MCP uses the same unit-based system as Semrush API.

**Check Your Balance:**
1. Go to Semrush â†’ My Profile â†’ Subscription Info
2. View Standard API units and Trends API units

**Typical Consumption:**
- Domain overview: 10 units
- Keyword report (100 keywords): 10 units
- Backlinks overview: 1 unit
- Organic search report: 10 units

**Refer to:**
- [Trends API Reference](https://www.semrush.com/api-documentation/)
- [API Limits & Consumption](https://www.semrush.com/kb/845-api-units)

---

## Access Requirements

**Minimum Required:**
- SEO Business plan (Standard API access), OR
- Any Trends API subscription (Basic or Premium)

**Not Included:**
- SEO plans below Business tier
- Free accounts

**Check your plan:** My Profile â†’ Subscription Info â†’ Summary

## Available MCP Tools

The AI agent will use these tools automatically:

1. **semrush_report** - Fetch specific Semrush reports
2. **semrush_report_list** - List available report types
3. **semrush_report_schema** - Get report structure/fields

You don't need to call these directly - just use natural language!

---

## Troubleshooting

### OAuth Errors

**Error:** "Redirect URI not allowed"
- Contact Semrush Support with your AI agent name
- They'll whitelist the redirect URI

### Connection Issues

**Check:**
1. MCP server URL is correct: `https://mcp.semrush.com/v1/mcp`
2. AI agent supports OAuth 2.1
3. AI agent supports streamable HTTP transport

### No Data Returned

**Verify:**
1. You have access to the API (check subscription)
2. You have enough API units (check balance)
3. Authentication completed successfully
4. Query syntax is correct

### Missing Tools

If `semrush_report`, `semrush_report_list`, or `semrush_report_schema` aren't available:

1. Verify authentication completed
2. Check Semrush access level
3. Look for errors in AI agent console
