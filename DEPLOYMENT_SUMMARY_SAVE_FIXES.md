**Deployment Date**: 2025-10-16 10:23 UTC
**Deployment ID**: `Fq3xVCuWi`
**Status**: ✅ **READY**
**Build Time**: 2m 15s
**Commit**: `5fd755d` - "fix: Update ClientIntakeFormV2 and add save issues documentation"

---

## ✅ Issues Fixed and Deployed

### 1. Intermittent Saving (UI Cutting In/Out) - FIXED ✅

**Problem**: Form was auto-saving every 2 seconds on ANY change, causing constant UI stuttering

**Solution**:
- Disabled constant auto-save watcher
- Changed to save-on-step-navigation
- Saves now happen only when user clicks "Next Step"

**Result**: Smooth typing experience, no more UI interruptions

---

### 2. Company Details Not Persisting - FIXED ✅

**Problem**: When returning to form, all data was lost and users had to start from scratch

**Solution**:
- Added URL-based auto-load functionality
- Form automatically loads saved data when URL contains `businessName` and `email` parameters
- Restores exact step user was on
- Shows "✅ Progress Restored!" confirmation toast

**Result**: Users can now resume exactly where they left off

- **Code Changes**: [components/onboarding/ClientIntakeFormV2.tsx](components/onboarding/ClientIntakeFormV2.tsx:302-394)

---

## 🚨 Known Limitations

1. **URL Parameters Required for Auto-Load**
   - Users must visit onboarding with `?businessName=X&email=Y` parameters
   - Without parameters, form starts fresh (expected behavior)
   - **Future Enhancement**: Add "Resume Progress" modal on homepage

2. **Case-Sensitive Lookup**
   - Business name and email must match exactly (case-sensitive)
   - **Future Enhancement**: Implement case-insensitive search

---

## 💡 Optional Future Enhancements

### 1. Add "Resume Progress" Button
- Add button on homepage: "Resume Onboarding"
- Modal asks for business name + email
- Redirects to onboarding with URL parameters
- **Priority**: Medium

### 2. Add Manual "Save Progress" Button
- Add explicit "Save Progress" button in form
- Gives users more control
- Shows save confirmation
- **Priority**: Low (save-on-navigation already works well)

### 3. Add Email Reminder System
- Email users with resume link if onboarding incomplete
- "Continue where you left off" CTA
- Includes pre-filled URL with parameters
- **Priority**: Medium
