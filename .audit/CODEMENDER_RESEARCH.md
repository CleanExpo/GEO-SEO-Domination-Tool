# CodeMender Research - DeepMind AI Code Security Agent

**Research Date:** 2025-10-09
**Status:** Not publicly available (research phase)
**Official Announcement:** October 6, 2025

---

## Executive Summary

**CodeMender is NOT available on GitHub.** It's a proprietary Google DeepMind research project announced in October 2025. However, we can replicate its approach using open-source tools and AI agents for our E2E audit.

---

## What is CodeMender?

CodeMender is an **AI-powered autonomous agent** from Google DeepMind that:
- Automatically detects software vulnerabilities
- Generates security patches
- Rewrites code to eliminate entire classes of vulnerabilities
- Validates fixes for correctness and no regressions

### Key Results
- **72 security fixes** submitted to open-source projects in 6 months
- Works on codebases up to **4.5 million lines of code**
- Notable fix: Applied `-fbounds-safety` annotations to libwebp (would have prevented 2023 iOS zero-click exploit)

---

## Technical Architecture

### Core Components

1. **AI Model: Gemini Deep Think**
   - Advanced reasoning capabilities
   - Capable of complex debugging
   - Multi-step problem solving

2. **Program Analysis Tools**
   - **Static Analysis** - Code pattern scrutiny, control flow, data flow
   - **Dynamic Analysis** - Runtime behavior testing
   - **Differential Testing** - Compare behavior before/after patches
   - **Fuzzing** - Automated input testing to find edge cases
   - **SMT Solver** - Formal verification of code properties

3. **Multi-Agent System**
   - **LLM-based Critique Tool** - Reviews and critiques proposed patches
   - **Code Comparison Agent** - Validates changes don't introduce regressions
   - **Root Cause Analysis Agent** - Identifies underlying vulnerability causes

### Validation Pipeline

```
1. Vulnerability Detection
   ↓
2. Root Cause Analysis
   ↓
3. Patch Generation (Gemini Deep Think)
   ↓
4. Multi-Agent Critique
   ↓
5. Differential Testing
   ↓
6. Fuzzing & SMT Validation
   ↓
7. Human Review (current requirement)
   ↓
8. Upstream Submission
```

### Capabilities

**Reactive:**
- Instantly patches newly discovered vulnerabilities
- Fixes known CVEs and security issues

**Proactive:**
- Rewrites existing code for improved security
- Eliminates entire vulnerability classes
- Applies modern safety features (bounds checking, sanitization)

---

## Why CodeMender Isn't Available

1. **Research Phase** - Still being developed and refined
2. **Human Oversight Required** - All patches currently reviewed by researchers
3. **Gradual Rollout** - Reaching out to open-source maintainers cautiously
4. **Future Release Planned** - DeepMind "hopes to release CodeMender as a tool for all software developers"

## CodeMender-Inspired E2E Audit Strategy

Since CodeMender isn't available, we'll replicate its approach using **existing open-source tools + Claude Code**:

### 1. Static Analysis Tools (CodeMender uses these)

#### ESLint + TypeScript Strict Mode
```bash
npm install -D eslint @typescript-eslint/parser @typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin
npx eslint . --ext .ts,.tsx --fix
```

#### SonarQube Community Edition
```bash
docker run -d --name sonarqube -p 9000:9000 sonarqube:lts-community
npx sonar-scanner
```

#### Semgrep (Open-source SAST)
```bash
npm install -g @semgrep/cli
semgrep --config=auto .
```

### 2. Dynamic Analysis & Fuzzing

#### Playwright for E2E Testing
```bash
npm install -D @playwright/test
npx playwright test
```

#### Artillery for API Load Testing
```bash
npm install -D artillery
artillery run load-test.yml
```

### 3. Security Scanning

#### npm audit + Snyk
```bash
npm audit fix
npx snyk test
npx snyk monitor
```

#### TruffleHog (Secret Scanning)
```bash
docker run --rm -v "$(pwd):/pwd" trufflesecurity/trufflehog:latest filesystem /pwd
```

#### OWASP Dependency-Check
```bash
npx dependency-check --project "GEO-SEO Tool" --scan .
```

### 4. AI-Powered Code Review (Claude Code)

#### Use Claude Code Agents
```bash
# Static analysis with general-purpose agent
claude-code analyze --scope security --output .audit/security-findings.md

# Automated fix generation
claude-code fix --input .audit/security-findings.md --branch audit/security-fixes
```

### 5. Differential Testing

#### Jest Snapshot Testing
```bash
npm install -D jest @types/jest
npx jest --updateSnapshot
```

#### API Contract Testing (Postman/Newman)
```bash
npm install -D newman
newman run api-tests.postman_collection.json
```

### 6. SMT-like Validation (TypeScript Type Checking)

```bash
# Enable strict mode for formal type guarantees
npx tsc --strict --noEmit
```

```bash
pip install sourcery
sourcery review .
```

### 5. **OpenAI Codex Cloud** (Most Similar)

## Implementation Plan for E2E Audit

### Phase 1: Setup Open-Source Tools (Week 1)
```bash
# 1. Install Semgrep
npm install -g @semgrep/cli

# 2. Install Snyk
npm install -g snyk
snyk auth

# 3. Setup CodeQL
gh extension install github/gh-codeql

# 4. Install SonarQube Scanner
npm install -D sonarqube-scanner

# 5. Setup TruffleHog
docker pull trufflesecurity/trufflehog:latest
```

### Phase 2: Run Comprehensive Scans (Week 1-2)
```bash
# Security
semgrep --config=auto --sarif > .audit/semgrep.sarif
snyk test --json > .audit/snyk.json
docker run -v "$(pwd):/pwd" trufflesecurity/trufflehog:latest filesystem /pwd > .audit/secrets.txt

# Code Quality
npx eslint . --format json > .audit/eslint.json
npx tsc --noEmit --pretty false 2> .audit/typescript-errors.txt

# Dependencies
npm audit --json > .audit/npm-audit.json
npx dependency-check --project "GEO-SEO" --scan . --format JSON > .audit/owasp-deps.json
```

### Phase 3: AI-Powered Analysis (Week 2-3)
```bash
# Use Claude Code general-purpose agent to analyze findings
# This mimics CodeMender's Gemini Deep Think approach
claude-code analyze \
  --input .audit/semgrep.sarif,.audit/snyk.json,.audit/eslint.json \
  --prompt "Analyze all security findings, prioritize by severity, and generate fix recommendations" \
  --output .audit/ai-analysis.md
```

### Phase 4: Automated Fixes (Week 3-5)
```bash
# Use Claude Code to generate fixes (CodeMender-style)
claude-code fix \
  --input .audit/ai-analysis.md \
  --branch audit/automated-fixes \
  --validate \
  --test-before-commit
```

### Phase 5: Validation Pipeline (Week 5-6)
```bash
# Run full test suite

## Conclusion

While **CodeMender is not available on GitHub**, we can replicate its approach using:
- **Static/Dynamic Analysis** → Semgrep, ESLint, Playwright
- **Security Scanning** → Snyk, TruffleHog, OWASP
- **AI Reasoning** → Claude Code with general-purpose agents
