# ✅ Task 5 Complete: Task Management Page

**Completion Time**: October 13, 2025
**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETE** (5 of 6 tasks done - 83% complete)

---

## What Was Built

### 1. Agent Tasks API Endpoint ✅
**File**: `app/api/agent-tasks/route.ts` (89 lines)

**Purpose**: Fetch agent tasks with comprehensive filtering

**Features**:
- Filter by status (pending, in_progress, completed, failed)
- Filter by category (content, performance, seo, accessibility, etc.)
- Filter by priority (critical, high, medium, low)
- Returns summary statistics
- Groups tasks by status and category

**API Response**:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "tasks": [...],
  "total": 12,
  "summary": {
    "by_status": {
      "pending": 5,
      "in_progress": 2,
      "completed": 3,
      "failed": 1,
      "requires_review": 1
    },
    "by_category": {
      "content": 4,
      "seo": 5,
      "performance": 3
    }
  }
}
```

### 2. Task Management Page ✅
**File**: `app/companies/[id]/tasks/page.tsx` (838 lines)

**Purpose**: Comprehensive task management interface with Swiss watch precision

**Key Features**:

#### A. Summary Statistics Dashboard
```typescript
// 5 stat cards showing at-a-glance metrics
- Total Tasks
- Pending (gray)
- In Progress (blue)
- Completed (green)
- Failed (red)
```

#### B. Advanced Filtering System
```typescript
// 4 filter controls
1. Search Bar - Search by task type, URL, or category
2. Status Filter - All/Pending/In Progress/Completed/Failed/Requires Review
3. Category Filter - All/Content/Performance/SEO/Accessibility/Security/UX/Technical
4. Priority Filter - All/Critical/High/Medium/Low
```

#### C. Task Cards with Rich Details
```typescript
// Each task card displays:
- Status icon (checkmark, spinner, X, clock, alert)
- Task type (formatted from snake_case)
- Status badge (color-coded)
- Priority badge (color-coded border)
- Category badge (with icon)
- Page URL (if applicable)
- Estimated time vs Actual time
- Creation date
- Expandable details section
```

#### D. Task Actions
```typescript
// Status-dependent action buttons:

// PENDING (no approval required):
- Execute button (green) → Calls /api/agent-tasks/[id]/execute

// PENDING (requires approval):
- Approve button (blue) → Calls /api/agent-tasks/[id]/approve
- Reject button (red) → Prompts for reason, calls /api/agent-tasks/[id]/reject

// COMPLETED (with snapshots):
- View Changes button → Shows before/after screenshots

// ALL:
- Expand/collapse button → Shows execution logs and instructions
```

#### E. Expandable Task Details
```typescript
// When expanded, shows:
1. Task Instructions (JSON formatted, pretty-printed)
2. Execution Logs (real-time progress):
   - Timestamp
   - Log level (debug/info/warning/error/success)
   - Message
   - Progress percentage
   - Color-coded by severity
   - Scrollable log viewer (max height 400px)
```

#### F. Real-Time Execution
```typescript
// Execute button behavior:
1. Shows loading spinner "Executing..."
2. Disables button during execution
3. Fetches task logs automatically
4. Updates task list after completion
5. Shows alert with execution time
6. Handles errors gracefully
```

#### G. Error Handling
```typescript
// Error display:
- Global error banner at top
- Per-task error messages (red box)
- Failed status indicator
- Error message from API
```

#### H. Empty States
```typescript
// Two empty state scenarios:
1. No tasks exist → "Run comprehensive audit to generate tasks"
2. Filters produce no results → "No tasks match your current filters"
```

## Integration with Existing System

### Connected Endpoints ✅
1. **GET `/api/agent-tasks`** - Fetch tasks with filters (NEW)
2. **POST `/api/agent-tasks/create-from-audit`** - Generate tasks from audit (EXISTING)
3. **POST `/api/agent-tasks/[id]/execute`** - Execute WordPress/FTP/GitHub tasks (EXISTING)
4. **POST `/api/agent-tasks/[id]/approve`** - Approve task (TO BE BUILT)
5. **POST `/api/agent-tasks/[id]/reject`** - Reject task (TO BE BUILT)
6. **GET `/api/agent-tasks/[id]/logs`** - Fetch execution logs (TO BE BUILT)

### Database Tables Used ✅
- `agent_tasks` - Main task storage
- `task_execution_logs` - Execution audit trail
- `website_credentials` - WordPress/FTP credentials
- `companies` - Company details
- `seo_audits` - Audit linkage

## What Still Needs Building

### 1. Approve Task Endpoint
**File**: `app/api/agent-tasks/[id]/approve/route.ts` (50 lines estimated)

**Purpose**: Mark task as approved and ready for execution

**Implementation**:
```typescript
// Update agent_tasks:
// - approved_by = current user ID
// - approved_at = NOW()
// - status = pending (if was requires_review)
```

### 2. Reject Task Endpoint
**File**: `app/api/agent-tasks/[id]/reject/route.ts` (50 lines estimated)

**Purpose**: Mark task as rejected with reason

**Implementation**:
```typescript
// Update agent_tasks:
// - rejected_by = current user ID
// - rejected_at = NOW()
// - rejection_reason = reason from body
// - status = cancelled
```

### 3. Task Logs Endpoint
**File**: `app/api/agent-tasks/[id]/logs/route.ts` (40 lines estimated)

**Purpose**: Fetch execution logs for a specific task

**Implementation**:
```typescript
// SELECT * FROM task_execution_logs
// WHERE task_id = xxx
// ORDER BY timestamp ASC
```

### 4. View Changes Modal (Optional)
**Component**: Modal to display before/after snapshots side-by-side

**Implementation**:
- Display before_snapshot and after_snapshot URLs
- Show images side-by-side
- Highlight differences
