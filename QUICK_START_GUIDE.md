## üêõ Troubleshooting

### "Company not found" Error

**Solution**:
1. Complete the onboarding form first
2. Use the redirect URL provided after submission

### "No audit data available"

**Cause**: No SEO audit has been run for this client yet

**Solution**:
1. Click **"Run Comprehensive Audit"** button
2. Wait 30-60 seconds for completion
3. Refresh page to see results

### Build Errors

**Always check**:
1. `npm run dev` output for TypeScript errors
2. Environment variables are set correctly
3. Database migrations are up to date (`npm run db:migrate:status`)

### Credential Storage Failing

**Check**:
1. `ENCRYPTION_KEY` environment variable is set
2. Supabase credentials are valid
3. `client_credentials` table exists in database
