## 📡 CATEGORY 2: API Endpoint Testing (0% Pass Rate) - CRITICAL

### ❌ All API Endpoints Return 404

**Critical Finding:** All 6 tested API endpoints are not accessible in production.

1. **GET /api/crm/portfolios** → 404
2. **GET /api/crm/calendar** → 404
3. **GET /api/crm/influence** → 404
4. **GET /api/crm/trends** → 404
5. **GET /api/companies** → 404
6. **POST /api/onboarding/load** → 404

### 🔍 Analysis

**Possible Causes:**
1. **API Routes Not Deployed** - Next.js `/api` routes may not be included in Vercel build
2. **Build Configuration Issue** - `next.config.js` may exclude API routes
3. **Incorrect API Paths** - Endpoints may have different paths in production
4. **Authentication Required** - APIs may require auth headers (returning 404 instead of 401)

### 🛠️ Recommended Fixes

**HIGH PRIORITY:**
1. Check Vercel deployment logs for API route errors
2. Verify `next.config.js` includes API routes in build
3. Test API endpoints manually in production
4. Add authentication tokens to test if needed
5. Check if APIs are under different base path (e.g., `/api/v1/...`)

## 💾 CATEGORY 3: Data Operations (33.3% Pass Rate)

### ✅ Passing Operations

1. **Create Company - Form Input** ✅
   - Onboarding form accepts input
   - Form state updates correctly
   - Input validation works

### ❌ Failing Operations

2. **Read Companies List** ❌
   - Issue: No companies list or empty state found
   - **Possible Cause:** Page structure changed or requires login

3. **Update - Save Progress** ❌
   - Issue: Test incomplete (selector issue)
   - **Fix:** Update save button selector syntax

---

## 🔗 CATEGORY 4: Integration Testing (33.3% Pass Rate)

   - Calendar UI loads successfully
   - Visual components present

### ❌ Failing Integrations

2. **Google OAuth Button** ❌

   button:has-text("Google"), text=Sign in with Google

   // Correct:
   button:has-text("Google")
   ```

3. **API Keys Configuration Check** ❌
   - Issue: `process is not defined` in browser context
   - **Fix:** API keys should be checked on server-side or via actual API calls
