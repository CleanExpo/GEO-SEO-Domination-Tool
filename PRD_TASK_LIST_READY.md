## üìä Current Test Status

**Playwright E2E Test Results** (from production):

### ‚úÖ Working Steps:
- Step 1: Business Info - Form fills, moves to Step 2
- Step 2: Website Details - Form fills, moves to Step 3
- Step 3: SEO Goals - Checkboxes, keywords work
- Step 4: Content Strategy - Brand voice captured
- Step 5: Services & Budget - Services selected
- API Submission: Returns success with onboarding ID

### ‚ùå Failures:
- **Next Button Timeout** (50% of tests):
  - Button stays `disabled` indefinitely
  - Timeout after 30,000ms
  - Element not enabled despite all fields filled

- **CSP Worker Violation** (100% of tests):
  - Error: `Refused to create a worker from 'blob:...'`
  - CSP directive: `script-src` used as fallback
  - Need to add: `worker-src 'self' blob:`

## üéØ Success Criteria (from PRD)

### Primary KPIs
- **Onboarding Completion Rate**: Target 90%+ (currently ~50% due to disabled button bug)
- **Average Time to Complete**: Target < 5 minutes
- **Error Rate**: Target < 1% failed submissions
- **Business Lookup Success Rate**: Target 70%+ auto-fill rate

### Quality Metrics
- **Zero CSP Errors**: 100% of browser sessions

## üöÄ Next Steps

### Phase 2: Generate Detailed Sub-Tasks

**To continue**, respond with:
```
Go
```

This will trigger Phase 2, which breaks down each of the 7 parent tasks into **detailed, actionable sub-tasks** for implementation.

### Phase 3: Execute Tasks Step-by-Step

Once sub-tasks are generated, use:
```
/process-task-list

Start on task 1.1
```

The AI will:
1. Implement task 1.1
2. Wait for your review
3. Mark complete ‚úÖ after approval
4. Move to task 1.2

You simply respond: **"yes"** or **"continue"** to approve each task.
