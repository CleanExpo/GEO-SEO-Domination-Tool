## 🔴 Critical Issues (All Resolved!)

### 1. Build Process ✅ FIXED
**Status:** RESOLVED
**Fix Applied:** Installed missing TypeScript type definitions
- Added @types/pg
- Added @types/qs
- Added @types/body-parser
- Added @types/ms

### 2. API Routes Security ✅ FIXED
**Status:** RESOLVED (Commit: 46e4a5a)
**Fix Applied:** Updated all API routes to use user-scoped client

**What was fixed:**
- Updated 31 API route files (Companies, Keywords, SEO Audits, CRM, Projects, Resources, Rankings, Health)
- Added `const supabase = await createClient()` in all handler functions
- Each request now creates a user-scoped Supabase client
- RLS policies properly enforce user data isolation

**Security improvement:**
- BEFORE: Users could potentially access other users' data ❌
- AFTER: Each request properly scoped to authenticated user ✅

### 3. Unsafe Environment Variable Fallbacks ✅ FIXED
**Status:** RESOLVED (Commit: 091082c)
**Fix Applied:** Removed placeholder fallbacks, added strict validation

**What was fixed:**
- Removed `'https://placeholder.supabase.co'` fallback
- Removed `'placeholder-key'` fallback
- Added explicit validation that throws errors if env vars missing
- Now fails fast with clear error messages

### 4. Database Tables - User Context ✅
**Status:** GOOD
**Current tables with user_id:**
- ✅ companies
- ✅ keywords
- ✅ audits
- ✅ crm_contacts
- ✅ crm_deals
- ✅ crm_tasks
- ✅ crm_calendar_events

**Note:** Additional tables (rankings, seo_audits, reports) should include `user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id)` when created

---

## ⚠️ Medium Priority Issues

### Environment Variables
**Issue:** Placeholder fallbacks in lib/supabase.ts could hide configuration errors

**Current:**
```typescript
const supabaseUrl = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL || 'https://placeholder.supabase.co';
```

**Recommended:**
```typescript
if (!process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL) {
  throw new Error('Missing NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL');
}
```

### Missing Features
1. Email verification flow - Not implemented
2. Password reset - Not implemented
3. User profile settings - Placeholder only
4. API rate limiting - Not configured
5. Notification system - Tables exist, no implementation
6. Support tickets - Placeholder only

---

## 📋 Recommendations

### Immediate (Today)
1. ✅ **Fix build errors** - COMPLETED
2. **Update API routes** - Use proper Supabase client
3. **Test RLS policies** - Verify data isolation
4. **Remove placeholder fallbacks** - Fail fast on missing env vars

### This Week
1. **Add API route tests** - Verify RLS enforcement
2. **Document OAuth setup** - For team members
3. **Add database migration guide** - For future tables
4. **Remove unused dependencies** - Clean package.json

### Next Sprint
1. **Implement email verification**
2. **Add password reset flow**
3. **Build user settings page**
4. **Add API rate limiting**
5. **Implement notification system**

---

## 🔒 Security Status

### Implemented ✅
- Row Level Security on all tables
- User data isolation policies
- Protected routes with middleware
- Secure session handling
- OAuth with Google

### Needs Attention ⚠️
- API routes may bypass RLS (see Issue #2)
- No rate limiting on API endpoints
- Missing CSRF protection
- No API key rotation strategy

## 🚀 Quick Fix Checklist

```bash
# 1. Build fixes (DONE)
cd web-app
npm install --save-dev @types/pg @types/qs @types/body-parser @types/ms

# 2. Update API routes (TODO - Manual)
# Replace in ALL files under web-app/app/api/:
# FROM: import { supabase } from '@/lib/supabase'
# TO:   import { createClient } from '@/lib/auth/supabase-server'
#       const supabase = await createClient()

# 3. Test deployment
npm run build
git add .
git commit -m "Security: Fix API routes to use proper Supabase client"
git push

# 4. Verify in production
# - Test login/signup
# - Create test data
# - Verify data isolation between users
```
