# üö® SECURITY INCIDENT RESPONSE - IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED

**Date:** October 15, 2025, 7:48 PM
**Severity:** CRITICAL
**Status:** Active Incident - Requires Immediate Action

## What Happened

API keys were inadvertently shared in plain text in the chat interface, which means they are now:
- ‚ùå Stored in chat logs
- ‚ùå Potentially visible to others
- ‚ùå No longer secure
- ‚ùå Need immediate rotation

## Compromised Keys

1. **WhoisXML API Key** - Service: WHOIS lookups
2. **Hunter.io API Key** - Service: Email discovery & enrichment

## ‚ö†Ô∏è IMMEDIATE ACTIONS REQUIRED

### Step 1: Rotate API Keys (DO THIS NOW)

#### WhoisXML API
1. Go to: https://user.whoisxmlapi.com/
2. Log in to your account
3. Navigate to API Keys section
4. **REVOKE** the current key immediately
5. Generate a NEW API key
6. Save it securely (see Step 2)

#### Hunter.io API
1. Go to: https://hunter.io/api-keys
2. Log in with Phil's Google account
3. **REVOKE** the current API key immediately
4. Generate a NEW API key
5. Save it securely (see Step 2)

### Step 2: Store Keys Securely (LOCAL ONLY)

Create/update your local `.env.local` file (this file is gitignored):

```bash
# Run this command in your terminal (NOT in chat):
# Replace YOUR_NEW_KEY_HERE with the actual new keys

echo "WHOIS_API_KEY=YOUR_NEW_WHOIS_KEY_HERE" >> .env.local
echo "HUNTER_API_KEY=YOUR_NEW_HUNTER_KEY_HERE" >> .env.local
```

### Step 3: Add to Vercel (PRODUCTION)

1. Go to Vercel Dashboard
2. Navigate to: Your Project ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Environment Variables
3. Add these variables:
   - Variable name: `WHOIS_API_KEY`
   - Value: [Your new WhoisXML key]
   - Environments: Production, Preview, Development
   
4. Add second variable:
   - Variable name: `HUNTER_API_KEY`
   - Value: [Your new Hunter.io key]
   - Environments: Production, Preview, Development

5. Click "Save"
6. Redeploy your application

## What I Will Do (Securely)

‚úÖ I will create the API integration code that uses `process.env.WHOIS_API_KEY` and `process.env.HUNTER_API_KEY`
‚úÖ I will NOT include any actual key values in any files
‚úÖ All integration code will assume the environment variables exist
‚úÖ No secrets will be committed to the repository

## Security Best Practices Going Forward

### ‚úÖ DO:
- Store all secrets in `.env.local` (local development)
- Store all secrets in Vercel Environment Variables (production)
- Use `process.env.VARIABLE_NAME` in code
- Keep secrets out of chat, code, and version control

### ‚ùå DON'T:
- Share API keys in chat
- Commit secrets to Git
- Hardcode secrets in code files
- Screenshot or share secrets anywhere

## Files That Are Safe

These files are gitignored and will NOT be committed:
- `.env.local`
- `.env`
- `.env.production`
- `.env.development`
- Any file matching `.env*`

## Next Steps

1. ‚úÖ Rotate both API keys immediately
2. ‚úÖ Add new keys to `.env.local` locally
3. ‚úÖ Add new keys to Vercel dashboard
4. ‚úÖ I will create the integration code
5. ‚úÖ Test the integrations with new keys

## Documentation Created

Once keys are rotated and stored securely, I will create:
- WhoisXML API integration module
- Hunter.io API integration module
- API service layer
- Type definitions
- Error handling
- Rate limiting
- Usage documentation

All code will reference `process.env.VARIABLE_NAME` - no actual keys will ever be in the code.

## Verification Checklist

- [ ] Old WhoisXML key revoked
- [ ] New WhoisXML key generated
- [ ] New WhoisXML key added to `.env.local`
- [ ] New WhoisXML key added to Vercel
- [ ] Old Hunter.io key revoked
- [ ] New Hunter.io key generated
- [ ] New Hunter.io key added to `.env.local`
- [ ] New Hunter.io key added to Vercel
- [ ] Verified `.env.local` is in `.gitignore`
- [ ] Integration code created (references env vars only)
- [ ] Production redeployed with new keys

## Support

If you need help with any of these steps, let me know and I'll guide you through it - but NEVER share the actual key values with me again.
