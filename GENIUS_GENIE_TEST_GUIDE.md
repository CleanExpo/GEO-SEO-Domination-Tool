## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "No opportunities found"

2. No Reddit discussions exist
3. Search volume too low (< 10/month)
4. DataForSEO API not configured

**Solutions**:
- Try more specific keywords
- Use niche-focused terms
- Verify `DATAFORSEO_API_KEY` in `.env.local`
- Check DataForSEO account has credits

---

### Issue: "Reddit API authentication failed"

**Solution**: Verify Reddit credentials in `.env.local`

```env
REDDIT_CLIENT_ID=M4djU9xQCA1ML7XgZA6UQ

REDDIT_USERNAME=International-Dish56
REDDIT_PASSWORD=Disaster/2028!

2. Verify Reddit account is active
3. Try logging into reddit.com manually
4. Check Reddit app status at https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps

---

### Issue: "Content generation failed"

**Possible Causes**:
1. `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` not set
2. Claude API quota exceeded
3. Opportunity has no questions extracted

**Solutions**:
- Verify `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` in `.env.local`
- Check Anthropic account quota
- Ensure opportunity has `top_questions` data
- Review API error in browser console (F12)

---

### Issue: "Discovery takes too long (>5 minutes)"

**Causes**:
- Too many keywords returned by DataForSEO
- Reddit API rate limiting
- Large number of comments to analyze

**Solutions**:
- Expected time: 2-3 minutes for 10 keywords
