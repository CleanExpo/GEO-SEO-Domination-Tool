## How It Works

### Step 1: Discover Trends

**Input:** Portfolio ID, Industry

**Process:**
1. Generate seed keywords (20+ terms)
2. Query multiple sources:
   - Google Trends (search momentum)
   - News aggregators (emerging topics)
   - Social media (viral discussions)
   - Research papers (scientific breakthroughs)
   - Regulatory updates (compliance changes)
3. AI synthesis and scoring
4. Filter by momentum (>50%) and competition (<70%)

**Output:** 10-20 ranked trends with:
- Opportunity score (0-100)
- Momentum velocity (rising/peaking/declining)
- Content ideas (3-5 per trend)
- E-E-A-T enhancement opportunities

**Example Trends for Fire Safety Industry:**
- "Smart smoke detection AI systems" (Opportunity: 92/100)
- "Lithium battery fire regulations 2024" (Opportunity: 88/100)
- "Fire-resistant building materials VOC testing" (Opportunity: 85/100)

### Step 2: Create Influence Campaign

**Input:** Trend ID, Campaign Goal, Duration, Platforms

**Process:**
1. AI generates 3-phase strategy:
   - **Phase 1 (30%):** Foundation - Build credibility
   - **Phase 2 (40%):** Amplification - Increase visibility
   - **Phase 3 (30%):** Dominance - Own the conversation
2. Plan 6-10 content pieces:
   - 1 Pillar Article (3000+ words)
   - 1 Research Report (whitepaper with original data)
   - 2-3 Expert Analysis pieces
   - 1 Case Study
   - 3-5 Social Posts
3. Add E-E-A-T enhancements per piece
4. Set target metrics (brand mentions, backlinks, conversions)

**Output:** Campaign plan with estimated impact:
- Estimated reach: 50,000+
- Brand mentions: 100+
- Backlinks: 25+
- CTA conversions: 50+
- Time to market leadership: 3-6 months

**Example Campaign:** "Smart Smoke Detection Revolution"

**Phase 1 (Days 1-27):** Foundation

- Research Report: "ROI Analysis: Traditional vs Smart Systems"
- LinkedIn Posts: Expert commentary on industry shift

**Phase 2 (Days 28-63):** Amplification
- Case Study: "How [Client] Reduced False Alarms by 85%"
- Expert Analysis: "Top 5 Smart Detection Systems Compared"
- Social Campaign: Infographics, videos, testimonials

**Phase 3 (Days 64-90):** Dominance
- Webinar: "Future of Fire Safety: AI Integration"
- Follow-up Articles: Address competitor claims, expand on research
- CTA Push: Free consultation offers

### Step 3: Execute Campaign

**Input:** Campaign ID

**Process:**
1. For each content piece:
   - Call Content Generation Agent (with E-E-A-T enhancements)
   - Generate visuals (images, infographics, diagrams)
   - Save to `content_empire` table
2. Schedule posts via Content Calendar Agent
3. Deploy via Auto-Deploy Agent when scheduled time arrives

**Output:** All content generated and scheduled

### Step 4: Monitor & Optimize
