## 🚀 Deployment Details

### Production Deployment:
- **Environment**: Vercel Production
- **Build Time**: 3 minutes
- **Status**: ✅ Ready
- **API Keys**: All configured and working
- **Database**: Supabase PostgreSQL (connected)

### API Key Status:
- ✅ `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` - Working (paid account)

   └─ If fail: Try Claude Opus

2. Try Claude Opus (premium)
   ├─ If success: Use Opus ($0.039 per query) ← CURRENT
   └─ If fail: Try Claude Sonnet 4.5

3. Try Claude Sonnet 4.5 (fallback)
   ├─ If success: Use Sonnet ($0.015 per query)
   └─ If fail: Return error to user
```

**Current State**: Claude Opus working perfectly (92.2% cost savings vs human)
