## 🎯 How to Use

### Three Simple Steps

#### 1. Create a PRD (Product Requirement Document)

```
/create-prd

Here's the feature I want to build: [Your feature description]
Reference these files: @file1.ts @file2.tsx
```

**Output**: `/tasks/0001-prd-[feature-name].md`

#### 2. Generate Task List

```
/generate-tasks

Use @0001-prd-[feature-name].md
```

**Output**: `/tasks/tasks-0001-prd-[feature-name].md`

#### 3. Execute Tasks One-by-One

```
/process-task-list

Start on task 1.1
```

**AI will**: Implement → Wait for approval → Mark complete ✅ → Next task
**You respond**: "yes" or "continue" to approve

## 🚀 Recommended First PRD: Dashboard Missing Pages

Based on Playwright test results, we have **14 failed tests** (53.8% failure rate). Many failures are due to missing or incomplete pages:

### Top Priority Features for PRDs:

**PRD Name**: `0001-prd-complete-dashboard-pages.md`
**Scope**:

- Fix Clients Page (404 error)
- Add missing sections to existing pages

**Impact**: Will fix 2 failed navigation tests (from 75% → 100% pass rate)

#### 2. **API Integration Health Checks** (Critical)
**Current Issue**: All 6 API endpoint tests failing (0% pass rate)
**PRD Name**: `0002-prd-api-health-monitoring.md`
**Scope**:
- Add health check endpoints for all APIs
- Create automated monitoring dashboard
- Set up alerts for API failures

**Impact**: Will improve API reliability and catch issues early

#### 3. **Google OAuth Integration** (User Flow)
**Current Issue**: OAuth button selector error
**PRD Name**: `0003-prd-google-oauth-signin.md`
**Scope**:
- Implement Google OAuth sign-in
- Fix button selectors for testing

```
/create-prd

Feature: Complete Dashboard Pages

Background:
- Main Dashboard page currently shows "Expected content not found" error
- Clients page returns 404 error
- Playwright navigation tests show 75% pass rate (6/8 tests)

Requirements:

   - Add welcome section with user greeting
   - Display summary statistics (companies tracked, audits completed, keywords monitored)
   - Show recent activity feed
   - Add quick action buttons (New Audit, Add Company, View Reports)

2. Fix Clients Page (/clients)
   - Create missing page route
   - List all companies with filtering/sorting
   - Display company cards with key metrics
   - Add "Add New Client" button

3. Ensure both pages match design system
   - Use existing Tailwind theme
   - Consistent with other dashboard pages
   - Responsive design (mobile/tablet/desktop)

Success Criteria:
- Playwright test "Load Main Dashboard" passes ✅
- Playwright test "Load Clients Page" passes ✅
- Navigation test pass rate increases to 100% (8/8)
- Pages load in < 2 seconds
