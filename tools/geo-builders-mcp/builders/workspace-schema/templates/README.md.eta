# Builder: workspace-schema

Creates three tables with RLS:
- `workspaces (id, name, slug, owner_id)`
- `workspace_memberships (workspace_id, user_id, role)`
- `projects (id, workspace_id, name, description)`

Policies grant read to members and write to owner/admin as appropriate. Also auto-adds owner to memberships via trigger.

**Apply:** run the generated SQL in Supabase SQL Editor (or your migration system).
