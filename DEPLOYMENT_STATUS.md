## Recent Build Issues

Some automatic deployments triggered by git pushes failed immediately (0ms build time). This is likely due to Vercel's automatic deployment triggering before files are fully synced.

**Solution**: Manually triggered deployment with `vercel deploy --prod --force` succeeded immediately.

**Recommendation**: Use manual deployments for critical updates until automatic deployment configuration is optimized.
