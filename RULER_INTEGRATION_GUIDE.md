# OpenPipe ART (RULER) Integration Guide

## 🧠 What is RULER?

**RULER (Relative Universal LLM-Elicited Rewards)** is a breakthrough in reinforcement learning that eliminates manual reward function engineering by using LLMs as automated performance judges.

### Traditional RL vs RULER

**Traditional Reinforcement Learning**:
```python
def manual_reward_function(trajectory):
    # 50+ lines of careful scoring logic
    score = 0
    if keyword_ranking_improved:
        score += 10
    if traffic_increased_by_20_percent:
        score += 15
    if bounce_rate_decreased:
        score += 5
    # ... 40+ more conditions
    return score
```

**With RULER**:
```typescript
// One-line automated scoring
const score = await ruler.scoreTrajectory(trajectory);
```

### Key Benefits

✅ **2-3x faster development** - No manual reward engineering
✅ **Zero labeled data required** - LLM judges automatically
✅ **General-purpose** - Works across all task types
✅ **Self-improving** - Learns from performance history
✅ **Matches/exceeds manual rewards** - Proven in 3/4 benchmarks

## 🎯 How RULER Works in Our System

### 1. Agent Executes Task
```typescript
// Agent performs SEO keyword research
const keywords = await deepseekSEO.researchKeywords("local plumber sydney");
```

### 2. RULER Evaluates Performance
```typescript
// Automatic performance scoring
const evaluation = await evaluateSEOTask(
  "Research keywords for local plumber in Sydney",
  ["local plumber sydney", "emergency plumber", ...],
  "Target long-tail keywords with commercial intent",
  {
    rankings: { "local plumber sydney": 12, "emergency plumber": 8 },
    traffic: 2500,
    conversions: 45
  }
);

// Returns:
{
  score: 87,  // 0-100
  reasoning: "Strong keyword selection with mix of high-volume and long-tail...",
  strengths: [
    "Good balance of commercial and informational keywords",
    "Included location-specific variations"
  ],
  weaknesses: [
    "Could include more question-based keywords"
  ],
  improvements: [
    "Add 'how to' and 'what is' variations",
    "Research seasonal trends"
  ],
  confidenceLevel: "high"
}
```

### 3. System Learns and Optimizes
```typescript
// After 10+ evaluations, generate insights
const insights = await ruler.generateLearningInsights("seo", 10);

// Returns patterns like:
[
  {
    pattern: "Including location-specific keywords",
    frequency: 15,
    successRate: 0.87,  // 87% success rate
    recommendation: "Continue using this approach - 87% success rate",
    examples: [...]
  }
]
```

### 4. Agent Improves Automatically
```typescript
// Get optimized approach based on learnings
const optimization = await ruler.optimizeAgentBehavior(
  "seo",
  "Current: Focus on high-volume keywords"
);

// Returns:
{
  optimizedApproach: "Focus on high-volume + long-tail mix with location modifiers",
  expectedImprovement: 23,  // 23% improvement expected
  rationale: "Historical data shows location modifiers increase success by 23%"
}
```

## 🚀 Implementation

### Setup

The RULER integration is ready to use:

1. **Core Engine**: `services/ai/ruler-integration.ts`
2. **API Endpoints**:
   - `/api/ruler/evaluate` - Evaluate task performance
   - `/api/ruler/optimize` - Get optimization recommendations
   - `/api/ruler/insights` - Generate learning insights

3. **Environment Variables** (already configured):
```bash
DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=your_key_here  # Primary judge (cheaper)
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key_here     # Fallback for critical tasks
```

## 🎯 Integration with Existing Modules

### SEO Module Integration

**File**: `services/api/deepseek-seo.ts`

Add RULER evaluation after each keyword research:

```typescript
import { evaluateSEOTask } from '@/services/ai/ruler-integration';

export class DeepSeekKeywordResearch {
  async researchKeywords(seedKeyword: string, options: any) {
    // Existing keyword research logic
    const keywords = await this.performResearch(seedKeyword, options);

    // RULER evaluation (async - doesn't block response)
    this.evaluateWithRULER(seedKeyword, keywords, options).catch(err =>
      console.error('RULER evaluation failed:', err)
    );

    return keywords;
  }

  private async evaluateWithRULER(
    seedKeyword: string,
    keywords: KeywordData[],
    options: any
  ) {
    // Wait for actual results (rankings, traffic) before evaluating
    // This would be called by a webhook/cron after 30 days
    const results = await this.getActualResults(seedKeyword);

    await evaluateSEOTask(
      `Research keywords for "${seedKeyword}"`,
      keywords.map(k => k.keyword),
      `Target ${options.includeQuestions ? 'questions + ' : ''}${options.includeLongTail ? 'long-tail' : 'primary'} keywords`,
      results
    );
  }
}
```

### Social Media Module Integration

**File**: `services/api/deepseek-social-media.ts`

```typescript
import { evaluateSocialMediaTask } from '@/services/ai/ruler-integration';

export class DeepSeekSocialMedia {
  async writeSocialPost(topic: string, platform: string) {
    const post = await this.generatePost(topic, platform);

    // Evaluate after post goes live (webhook from social platform)
    this.evaluateWithRULER(topic, platform, post).catch(err =>
      console.error('RULER evaluation failed:', err)
    );

    return post;
  }

  private async evaluateWithRULER(
    topic: string,
    platform: string,
    post: string
  ) {
    // Get actual engagement after 24 hours
    const results = await this.getPostResults(platform, post);

    await evaluateSocialMediaTask(
      `Create ${platform} post about "${topic}"`,
      platform,
      post,
      results
    );
  }
}
```

```

## 🎓 Best Practices

### 1. Start Small
- Evaluate 5-10 tasks manually first
- Verify RULER scores match your judgment
- Adjust judging prompts if needed

### 2. Wait for Real Results
- Don't evaluate immediately after task execution
- Wait 30 days for SEO results
- Wait 24-48 hours for social media results
- Wait 7 days for content performance

### 3. Use Consistent Metrics
- Always track the same KPIs (rankings, traffic, conversions)
- Use comparable time periods
- Normalize for external factors (seasonality, competition)

### 4. Review Insights Regularly
- Check insights weekly
- Implement high-confidence recommendations (>80% success rate)
- A/B test optimized approaches

### 5. Monitor Judge Quality
- Spot-check RULER scores vs manual evaluation
- Switch to OpenAI O3 for critical decisions
- Report incorrect judgments for debugging

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

### Phase 2 (4-6 weeks)
- ✅ RULER dashboard with visualizations
- ✅ Automatic approach optimization (no manual trigger)
- ✅ Multi-agent comparison (test 3 strategies, pick best)
